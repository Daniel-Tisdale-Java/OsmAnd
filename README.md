OsmAnd (OSM Automated Navigation Directions)
------------
This project aims at providing comfortable map viewing and navigation (routing) application for mobile devices. Particular stress lies with complete offline features (via pre-loaded offline map data) or economic internet usage.
To get started, continue with the basic description below, then find more detail on our Welcome Wiki Pages, the Project Homepage, or the OpenStreetMap OsmAnd Wiki Page.
You are welcome to discuss any question regarding the project at the Google group OsmAnd. Please do not use comments on wiki pages because it is rather difficult to find them.

Functionality
-------------
**OsmAnd (OSM Automated Navigation Directions)** is a map and navigation application with access to the free, worldwide, and high-quality OpenStreetMap (OSM) database.
All map data can be stored on your device's memory card for offline use.
Via your device's GPS, OsmAnd offers routing, with optical and voice guidance, for car, bike, and pedestrian usage.
All main functionalities work both online and offline (no internet needed).
